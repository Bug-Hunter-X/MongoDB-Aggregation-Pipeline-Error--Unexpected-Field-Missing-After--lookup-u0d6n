# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Unexpected Field Missing

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The issue stems from inconsistencies between the data structure expected by subsequent stages ($unwind, $group) and the actual results returned by the $lookup stage.

## Bug Description
The primary issue involves a missing field ('amount' in this case) in the results of the $lookup stage in the aggregation pipeline. This missing field causes the pipeline to fail unpredictably.  Error messages may not be directly related to the missing field.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install MongoDB and ensure your database is properly configured.
3. Run `bug.js` to reproduce the error.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correct the issue by adding proper error handling to check for the presence of the required field before further processing.  The alternative solution adds a conditional to check for the existence of the field within the $group stage to avoid failure.
